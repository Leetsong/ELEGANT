# fic-finder

## Intro

A self implementation of [FicFinder](http://sccpu2.cse.ust.hk/ficfinder/index.html)

## TODO

+ [ ] Make every apk containable, that is to say, every apk runs separately, fic-finder has the ability to handle multiple apks
+ [ ] A official website that can, receive apk and models rules, and return issues
+ [ ] The website can hold the following functions:
    + [ ] separate running a FIC checking using the predefined rules
    + [ ] separate running a FIC checking using self-defined i.e. customized rules
    + [ ] separate running a FIC checking using the mixed rules i.e. predefined and customized
    + [ ] request a list of api-models, well defined rules i.e. quite useful rules will be added to predefined rules
    + [ ] a graph showing the issue distributions on api-models
